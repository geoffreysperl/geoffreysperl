- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Geoffrey Sperl.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the interection of reading, writing, and technology. I spent most of the first two decades of the century managing IT support, and it's my opinion we could do so much better in IT if we were just better readers and writers. As remote work has become more prevalent, and as we rely on tools such as Slack and Teams (in addition to messaging and social media) to communicate with our world, reading and writing has become more and more important.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Markdown, Hugo, and Jekyll. I'm not a coder and have never had any interest in being one, but I recognize the importance code has in all facets of today's world.
