ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Geoffrey Sperl.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the interection of reading, writing, and technology. I'm not a coder. I love tech and came to working in IT during college, which led me to managing tech support. I am certified and experienced in ITIL, Knowledge-centered Service, and Agile (both DevOps and Scrum; I like Scrum so much, I had my kids use Kanban boards manage school at the start of the pandemic). I spent most of the first two decades of the century managing IT support and projects, and it's my opinion we could do so much better in IT if we were just better readers and writers. As remote work has become more prevalent, and as we rely on tools such as Slack and Teams (in addition to messaging and social media) to communicate with our world, reading and writing has become more and more important. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and using Markdown, Hugo, and Jekyll (and I am planning on returning to school to get my secondary education teaching certificate). No, I'm not a coder, but I recognize the importance code has in all facets of today's worldâ€”and I want to bring that to the classroom.
